# capston-project
As of 2020, San Francisco has the highest salaries, disposable income, and median home prices in the world at $1.7 million, as well as the highest median rents. In this project, we will use the Airbnb open data to analyze and visualize 2020 San Francisco Airbnb data for newcomers and travelers. Even investors can use this model to see which neighborhoods have great potential to make the most revenue. The result will contain charts and graphs for neighborhoods with most positive reviews, top neighborhoods by revenue as well as the most popular listings in the city.
